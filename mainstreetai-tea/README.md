# MainStreetAI Platform API (Phase 3)

Multi-business (multi-tenant) Express + TypeScript API for local marketing content with memory and learning.

## Features

- Brand profiles (local JSON): `data/brands/<brandId>.json`
- Brand CRUD: `/brands`
- Generation endpoints (brand-aware):
  - `POST /promo?brandId=<brandId>`
  - `POST /social?brandId=<brandId>`
  - `POST /events?brandId=<brandId>`
  - `POST /week-plan?brandId=<brandId>`
  - `POST /next-week-plan?brandId=<brandId>`
- Memory and learning:
  - Auto history log for generation endpoints
  - Posting log (`/posts`)
  - Performance log (`/metrics`)
  - Insights engine (`/insights`, `/insights/refresh`)

All OpenAI calls are centralized in:
- `src/ai/openaiClient.ts`
- `src/ai/runPrompt.ts`

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env

PORT=3001
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server: `http://localhost:3001`

## Data layout (local-first)

```
data/
  brands/    # brand profiles + optional index
  history/   # auto-saved generation outputs per brand
  posts/     # what was actually posted
  metrics/   # manual performance entries
  insights/  # cached insights summaries
```

    "goal":"repeat_customers",
    "focusAudience":"teachers"

```

## Logging + insights endpoints

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platform":"instagram",

    "redemptions":9,
    "salesNotes":"Busy after school around 3:30pm"
  }'
```

### Get insights

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/insights?brandId=main-street-nutrition"
```

### Refresh and cache insights

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/insights/refresh?brandId=main-street-nutrition"
```

## Phase 3 Workflow

1. Generate promo/social/week-plan content.
2. Log what actually got posted using `POST /posts`.
3. Log performance later with `POST /metrics` (24h/48h/7d).
4. Review recommendations via `GET /insights`.
5. Generate an improved weekly plan using `POST /next-week-plan`.

## Notes

- History is auto-saved after successful generation requests.
- Request and output validation uses `zod`.
- Insights are resilient when metrics are sparse (limited-data behavior).
- Model responses are parsed as JSON and validated, with one repair retry if needed.
