Task: Create one fast, practical "first win" plan for a small business owner.

Input JSON:
{
  "brand": {},
  "townProfile": {},
  "townPulse": {},
  "window": "morning|lunch|after_work|evening|weekend",
  "seasonTags": [],
  "support_level": "growing_fast|steady|struggling|just_starting"
}

Output JSON schema:
{
  "offerTitle": "string",
  "caption": "string",
  "signText": "string",
  "staffScript": "string",

Rules:
- Prioritize repeat traffic and familiar customers.
- Keep execution very simple (owner + small team can run it quickly).
- Use existing strengths, existing products/services, and existing staffing.
- Do not require new inventory.
- Avoid heavy discounts and avoid margin-risking offers.
- Prefer value-add framing, convenience, service quality, or timing-based nudges.
- Keep language warm, practical, and confidence-building.
- If townProfile is present, adapt wording to the town's identity and community focus.
- Keep each output field concise and immediately usable.
