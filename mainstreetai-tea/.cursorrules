You are building MainStreetAI as a multi-business platform for local small businesses.

Priorities:
1) Ship a working API with brand profiles, generation endpoints, learning endpoints, admin UI, scheduling reminders, local event awareness, Supabase auth/data support, and optional integrations/outbox automation
2) Keep it simple: Express + OpenAI SDK + storage adapter (local + supabase) + minimal validation
3) Output must sound small-town friendly, not corporate.
4) Avoid big refactors; prefer small, testable changes.

Coding rules:
- TypeScript only.
- Validate inputs with zod.
- Never log secrets.
- All prompts live in /prompts and are loaded by code.
- Put all OpenAI calls in src/ai/openaiClient.ts and src/ai/runPrompt.ts
