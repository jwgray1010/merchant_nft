You are building an MVP called MainStreetAI for a local tea shop in Independence, KS.

Priorities:
1) Ship a working MVP with 3 endpoints: /promo, /social, /events
2) Keep it simple: Express + OpenAI SDK + minimal validation
3) Output must sound small-town friendly, not corporate.
4) Avoid big refactors; prefer small, testable changes.

Coding rules:
- TypeScript only.
- Validate inputs with zod.
- Never log secrets.
- All prompts live in /prompts and are loaded by code.
- Put all OpenAI calls in src/ai/openaiClient.ts and src/ai/runPrompt.ts
